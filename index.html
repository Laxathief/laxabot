        <h2>Welcome to Project Verdansk</h2>
        Our goal is to demonstrate that with the help of small, concealable, affordable, Do-It-Yourself devices such as Arduino and Raspberry, you can exerce your right to free speech wherever you go.
        So far, Project Trinity's website will be hosted by an Atmel ATMega328P. 
        However, we are looking forward to add USB support for endless possibilities.
        <br><br>Why Verdansk ? Well, because Verdansk is an unstable, at war zone; ideal conditions to demonstrate our project if it were to be real.
        <br><br>We will use a manifesto as placeholder here. We stand in no way behind what will be written below.
        We name it "The Three Axis of Evil, or of greater good ?".
        It is a reference to 43rd President of the United States George W. Bush's speech on January 29, 2002.
        The manifesto constitutes itself of 3 axis, available below.

        <h2>About us (or me I guess)</h2>
        I'm a 15-year-old junior student, in France. 
        What my lazy ass mostly does is watch v-tubers, play, tinker and die of boredom.
        I'm not really a free speech advocate, but i'm forced to acknoledge that it is an important weapon for opposition.
        This project was designed with that it can be used by both democracy defenders as well as terrorist organisations in mind.
        I would be 
        I am no near having any responsability for whatever use or misuse you do of this, as it is open-source.

      We believe that waging a IIIrd World War will put an end to armed conflicts for centuries to come, as communism and far-right movements are on the rise.
      Humanity only remembers its dark episodes, it is up to us not to deceive ourselves. 
      For millenials men have fought mindlessly, but since 1914, war was given a horrific dimension. 
      The Great War, as they called it, was the first conflict which resulted into the will for greater good.
      However, grudge agaisnt Prussians led to the Second World War, with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, aka. the "FÃ¼hrer".
      The Cold War showed a struggle for power leading to imperialism, when values defended were all but.
      Use of proxy wars like Korea and Vietnam only lead the bloodshed and poverty. 
      Armed interventions in the Middle East in the name of communism (Afghanistan) and freedom (Irak) were key to the creation of islamic militias.
      Al-Qaeda and Daesh were only products of american interventonism hate. 
      Since the fall of the USSR/CCCP, old conflicts in Eastern Europe were revived as the greater entity that was the Russian Communist Party was no more.
      As of today, modern conventional warfare is of no use between sovereign entities. 
      Unconventional warfare is out of the question as well, since its power is so destructive that is is beyond our imagination.
      The change shall come internally, from the people. But what change ? That's what we're going to see, not sh*t Sherlock.
      <a id="c1"></a><br><br><br><br><h1>I. Leadership</h1>
      A New Order requires a new leadership. Indeed, no political system can be deemed sustainable, if challenged. 
      By establishing a worldwide new order, you are establishing a single new government, unchallenged, uncompromised.

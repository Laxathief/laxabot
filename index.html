        Our goal is to demonstrate that with the help of small, concealable, affordable, Do-It-Yourself devices such as Arduino and Raspberry, you can exerce your right to free speech wherever you go.
        So far, Project Trinity's website will be hosted by an Atmel ATMega328P. 
        However, we are looking forward to add USB support for endless possibilities.

        <br><br>The name Trinity comes from the manifesto we will use as placeholder here. 
        We name it "The Three Axis of Evil or How to Rule like a Totalitarian".
        It is a reference to 43rd President of the United States George W. Bush's speech on January 29, 2002.
        The manifesto constitutes itself of 3 axis, available below.

        <h2>About us (or me I guess)</h2>
        I'm a 15-year-old junior student, in France. 
        What my lazy ass mostly does is watch v-tubers, prototype and die of boredom.
        I'm not really a free speech advocate, but i'm forced to acknoledge that it is an important weapon for opposition.
        This project was designed with that it can be used by both democracy defenders as well as terrorist organisations in mind.
        It is a political tool, created with no political intentions.
        I am no near having any responsability for whatever use or misuse you do of this, as it will be open-source.

        Our goal is to demonstrate that with the help of small, concealable, affordable, Do-It-Yourself devices such as Arduino and Raspberry, you can exerce your right to free speech wherever you go.
        So far, Project Trinity's website will be hosted by an Atmel ATMega328P. 
        However, we are looking forward to add USB support for endless possibilities.

        <br><br>The name Trinity comes from the exposé we will use as placeholder here. 
        We name it "The Three Axis of Evil or How to Rule like a Totalitarian".

        The exposé constitutes itself of 3 chapters, available below.
